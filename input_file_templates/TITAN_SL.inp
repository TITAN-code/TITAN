# IN CASE CHARGETYPE = FRAGMENT, THE "SEQUENCE" IS DEFINED AS
# A SUCCESSION OF POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGE FRAGMENTS, WITH EACH FRAGMENT
# REPRESENTED BY "P" AND "N" RESPECTIVELY. THE NUMBER OF "P" AND "N"  
# SHOULD BE EQUAL IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THE NET CHARGE OF THE SPIRAL LINE IS ZERO.
# "FATOM" CORRESPONDS TO THE NUMBER OF POINTS IN EACH FRAGMENT. 
# FOR EXAMPLE: SEQUENCE = "PPNPNNNP" 

# IF THE “CHARGETYPE” KEYWORD IS SET TO "DNA", THE “FATOM" KEYWORD IS SET TO 7 AUTOMATICALLY.
# THE “CHARGE" KEYWORD IS SET AUTOMATICALLY BY TAKING THE CHARGE FROM THE SIRAH FORCE FIELD.
# PLEASE USE THE SYMBOL A G T C TO DEFINE THE SEQUENCE. 
# FOR EXAMPLE:  SEQUENCE = "ATAGGTACCCATG"
