TITAN - elecTric fIeld generaTion And maNipulation - is an open-source software package 
capable of (a) generating external electric fields by creating collections of point charges
around chemical systems, and (b) quantifying electric fields at any location based on a 
charge distribution, e. g. the local electric fields (LEF), caused by the charge 
distribution in distant regions, experienced at the active site of a (bio)chemical system.
